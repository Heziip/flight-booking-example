# Flight-Booking-Example - A Basic Flight Booking System Example

By: [@ramisayar](http://ramisayar.com)

This project was developed as part of my Teaching Assistant duties at McGill University for ECSE 321 - Introduction to Software Engineering. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a system built based on a UML Package Diagram, how to design a system using UML and how a design would translate into actual code. The project also demonstrates maven, javadoc and junit testing.

The Flight Booking System UML Diagram can be found in the Wiley book "UML in Practice", it is available in the McGill Schulich Library and you should have received a copy from your professor. The code base is split along the same packages and classes as in the diagram. The code faithfully follows the UML diagram and introduces no extra dependencies besides JUnit. The documentation has been pregenerated for you and can be found in the doc folder. I highly recommend you take a look at the integration and system tests to see an example of how the whole system integrates with each other.

Enjoy!

Cheers,
